# Text Replacer
# Initial version by Lawrence Angrave (angrave@illinois.edu) March 29, 2017.
# lines in this file that start with a hash # character, or are empty are ignored
# Other lines contain words. Words can be separated by spaces or commas or tabs. 
# The last word is the replacement text that can be substitued for one or more of the words.
# Words that a single letter are ignored (and will not be substited if by themselves)
# Using the data below the example below "bertrand" "Russel Bertrand" "Bertrand Russel" and "berty" would all be replaced with 1234568
# Mary is harder (there are two) - so mary would be replaced with [[[1234561,1234562]]]
# Only complete words will be matched in the source document. So Tom but not "Atom" or "Tomato"
